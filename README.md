HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language". It means it is a language for describing web-pages using ordinary text. HTML is not a complex programming language.Every web page is actually a HTML file. Each HTML file is just a plain-text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.A web site will often contain many html files that link to each other. You can edit HTML files with your favourite editor. HTML codes are structured using certian keywords to develope proper coding.

HTML tags are keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag. Note that the closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, but has an additional forward-slash ( / ) character. I tend to interperet this as the "end" or "close" character.There are some tags that are an exception to this rule, and where a closing tag is not required. The <img> tag for showing images is one example of this. Each HTML file must have the essential tags for it to be valid, so that web browsers can understand it and display it correctly. The rest of the HTML file can contain as little or as many tags as you want to display your content.

Attributes allow you to customise a tag, and are defined within the opening tag. Most attributes are optional for most tags, and are only used when you want to change something about the default way a tag is displayed by the browser. However, some tags such as the <img> tag has required attributes such as src and alt which are needed in order for the browser to display the web page properly.

My repository files contains test scripts for practice and self improvement. Files can also be shared following all copryright laws as defined in the license text file. Files were used with notepad and saved as a ".html" file then opened in visual studio for code editing. You can download visual studio from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and download the appropriate download for your desktop such as Mac/Windows.
